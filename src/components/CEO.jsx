            Meet <span>Ayo Mutiat Oyebisi</span>, the heart and creative mind behind
            Mercifield Event Place. She's not just a planner — she's a
            storyteller who believes every event should reflect joy, elegance,
            and the personality of the people being celebrated.
            <p>
              Mutiat’s journey into the world of events started with a deep love
              for hosting and making people feel special. Over the years, that
              passion has grown into a full-blown talent for turning ideas into
              beautiful, unforgettable moments. Whether it’s an intimate
              birthday dinner or a grand wedding, she brings the same level of
              care, creativity, and excitement.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the things people love most about Muriat is her eye for
              detail — especially when it comes to fruit design and
              cocktails/mocktails. Her signature fruit displays are more than
              just tasty — they’re art. And her colorful mocktails and
              refreshing cocktails? A total crowd favorite. What really sets her
              apart, though, is how much she truly cares.
            </p>
            <p>
              She listens, she understands, and she makes sure every client
              feels seen and celebrated. Under her leadership, Mercifield isn’t
              just an event space — it’s a place where good memories are made
              and shared.
